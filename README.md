# The Visual Overhaul
*Pretty UCI Registrar (PUR) modernizes UCI's archaic Class Registration & Schedule pages.*
- Schedule of Classes search & results page
- Class Prerequisite page
- Web Registration page
- UCI Authentication page
- Basic support for URLs with 'https://www.reg.uci.edu'

# Further
Pretty UCI Registrar (PUR) is essentially a dark mode modernization of the current UCI registration website. 

The most distinct feature is it's recoloring of all the pages, switching to an easier-on-the-eyes darker user interface with more pleasant, less jarring colors overall. In addition to this, PUR also adjusts the general padding and appearance of many elements to make them more modern and appeasing: adding extra space, rounded corners, and outlines where appropriate.

PUR is currently in development, with more to follow.
